# CryptoGenie
WELCOME to CryptoGenie!
CryptoGenie was created by three enthusiastic minds!
CryptoGenie is an encryption algorithm based on peer to peer encoded communication.
Every Peer picks five numbers from 1-9999999. That program will generate another set of numbers. Those will be shared to the other peer.
Doing so a random permutation algorithm is being generated.
You can explore more using our open source code.
Enjoy!
